# Quick Search

Quick Search is based on the beloved frame data discord bot [Yaksha](https://github.com/ellipses/Yaksha), made by my good and friend [Tom](https://twitter.com/TheEllipsis_).

## How to Use
Search for a move using the following format.

`characterName moveName`

For Example

`ZekuOld fireball lvl 1`

This will create a data card of the move you're looking for. You can tap more details to see everything the move does.

## Fuzzy Searching
Quick Search uses fuzzy searching so your spelling doesn't have to be perfect. Play around and see what you can find!
