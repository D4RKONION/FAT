# FAT Calculators

## Welcome!
FAT has a huge arsenal of 7 different calculators to help you become a Fighting Game pro.

A description of each calculator can be seen on the menu screen.

Further help can be found in the individual calculator's help screen.

## Disclaimer
The calculators do their best with the raw numbers from the frame data file. Some situations that if offers you __may be entirely impossible in game__.

There is no way for FAT to figure out what's actually possible in game, so you'll have to hit the lab and test it's suggestions out for yourself.

## Changing Character & States
You can change character or the state they're in (e.g. Jamie drink level) using the circular button in the bottom right.
