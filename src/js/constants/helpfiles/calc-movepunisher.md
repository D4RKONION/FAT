# Move Punisher

## How to Use
Move Punisher mode will show you a list of moves you can use to punish another characters selected move.

The dropdown menu contains a list of your __opponent's__ (i.e. the character being _punished_) moves.

When you select a move, __your character's__ (i.e. the character who is _punishing_) entire moveset will be checked against your opponent's selected move.

FAT will tell you how unsafe your opponent's move is and will give a list of available punishes.

## Changing Characters
You can change characters using the circular button in the bottom right.
