# Move Punisher

## What is a Punish?
A __Punish__ is a move that you counterattack your opponent with after you block something. Your opponent will still be recovering from their move so there's nothing they can do about it!

This calculator will list all moves you can use to punish another character's selected move.

## How to Use Move Punisher
The dropdown contains a list of your __opponent's__ moves (i.e. the character being _punished_). When you select a move, __your character's__ entire move-set will be checked against your opponent's selected move.

FAT will tell you how unsafe your opponent's move is and will give a list of available punishes. You can toggle whether you want your punishes to be normals and/or perfect (exactly as much startup as your opponent's unsafe move on block).
