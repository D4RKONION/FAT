# Move Linker

## What is a Link?
A __Link__ is a sequence of two moves which will combo. In order to qualify as a link, the first move must fully end before the second one begins (i.e. it is NOT a cancel)

This calculator will show you a list of moves you can link after the selected move.

## How to Use
The dropdown contains a list of __your character's__ moves.

When you select a move, your character's entire move set will be checked for moves that have equal or less start-up than the selected move. This will allow them to combo.

FAT will then list out the moves that can be linked and will tell you how tight a link it is.

## Counterhit & Punish Counter
Use the toggles to add frame advantage due to a counter hit or a punish counter. In SF6 & SFV Counterhit advantage is +2 most of the time. FAT will know if your move initiates a Crush Counter state (SFV).

In SF4, this is +1 frame of hit advantage for lights and +3 for almost everything else (some exceptions exist to this rule, for instance Blanka's cr.mk).
