# Move Linker

## How to Use
The Move Linker mode will show you a list of moves you can link after the selected move.

The dropdown menu contains a list of your character's moves.

When you select a move, your character's entire moveset will be checked for moves that have equal or less start-up than the selected move.

FAT will then list out the moves that can be linked and will tell you how tight a link it is.

### Counterhit
Use the counterhit button to add counterhit frame advantage In SFV this is +2 most of the time. FAT will know if your move initiates a Crush Counter state.

In SF4, this is +1 frame of hit advantage for lights and +3 for almost everything else (some exceptions exist to this rule, for instance Blanka's cr.mk).

## Changing Characters
You can change characters using the circular button in the bottom right.
