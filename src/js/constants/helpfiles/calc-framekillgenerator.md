## What is a Frame Kill?
A __Frame Kill__ is a sequence of actions you take after a _Knockdown_ that perfecly lines up your _Target Meaty_. This means the move you attack your opponent with as they get off the ground will allow no gaps for them to mash.

FKG will auto-generate these sequences for you given your selected parameters.

## Getting Started with FKG
FKG is a a detailed calculator with many inputs. However the only two that are required are Knockdown With & Target Meaty so let's start with them.

### Knockdown with
Select the move you will knock down your opponent with using the first dropdown. There are also some special entries which you can read about below.

### Target Meaty
Select the move that you want to hit your opponent with as they get off the ground.

### Results
Once you've set these two options, FAT will list sequences that start with your chosen Knockdown and end with your Target Meaty. Note that there isn't always a setup for your chosen inputs.

## Advanced Options

### Knockdown with Anything (Premium Only)
It can be laborious to check each knockdown for possible meaties with a particular move. Setting the Knockdown to __Anything__ will search all your knockdowns at once and display any setups in a list.

### Knockdown with Custom KDA
You'll often be at an unlisted amount of advantage due to how a combo ended (e.g. you juggled your opponent). If you know this amount (usually by checking some in game Frame Meter) you can input the frames with __Custom KDA__ to research that specific knockdown.

### Include late meaties
You can choose to allow some of your "meaties" to be a few frames late. These late meaties open up frame kill setups but aren't always helpful. Anything from 3 frames late onwards may be beatable or "fake". That's why the default is 0 (no late meaties).

### Setup Length
You can change how many moves are in the Setup Length to between 1 and 3. This is especially useful when Knocking down with Anything as the list and its calculations can be very long.

### Setup Contains
If you need a setup with a particular move incorporated into it, select that move here. I suggest __Forward Dash__ or __Drive Rush >__ as you'll often want to move closer to your opponent after you knock them down especially outside the corner.

### Recovery Type
Knockdowns can vary depending on what you hit your opponent with or what they choose to do as they get off the ground. The tabs at the top of the page control these parameters.
