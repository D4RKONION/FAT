## How to Use
This mode will auto generate setups that allow you to get perfect meaties every time! There are 4 separate inputs in Frame Kill Generator.

### Recovery Type
#### Quick
Quick means your opponent did a fast recovery on the spot. This is the default state for the calculator.

#### Back
Back means your opponent did a backroll recovery.

#### Both
Both will attempt to find a setup which covers both _Quick_ and _Back_ _Recovery_

#### None
None means your opponent did not recovery at all. They will get up slowly. Sometimes referred to as a "Normal Recovery" 

### Knockdown with
You select the move you will knock down with using the first dropdown.

### Include late meaties
You can choose to allow some of your "meaties" to be a few frames late. Anything from 3 frames late onwards may be beatable or "fake". The default state is "No".

### Setup Contains
Setup Contains' default state is "anything".

If you need a setup with a particular move incorporated though, select that move here. I suggest __Forward Dash__ as you'll often want to move closer to your opponent after you knock them down.

### Target Meaty
Finally you select your target meaty. This is the move that you want to hit your opponent with as they get off the ground.

## Results
After you've done all that, FAT will return 1, 2 or 3 move setups that give you your target meaty.",

## Changing Characters
You can change characters using the circular button in the bottom right.
