# String Interrupter

## How to Use
Select __your opponent's__ First and Second Moves to create a blockstring.

FAT will show you how you can cleanly interrupt that blockstring, and also how you can interrupt it by trading with the opponent. 

FAT knows to take SFV's move priority into account.

## Changing Characters
You can change characters using the circular button in the bottom right.
