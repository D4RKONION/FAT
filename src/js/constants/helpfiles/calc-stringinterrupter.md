# String Interrupter

## What is a String?
And how do I interrupt it?? A __String__ is a sequence of two moves. Interrupting a string means pushing a button between the two moves. This will hit your opponent before they have a chance to do their second move in the string. Some strings can not be interrupted.

This calculator will show you a list of moves you can use to interrupt a given string

## How to Use
Select __your opponent's__ First and Second Moves to create a string.

FAT will show you how you can cleanly interrupt that string, and also how you can interrupt it by trading with the opponent. You can change the opponent being tested using the circle in the bottom right.

Use the toggles to make your interruption safe and/or a normal.
