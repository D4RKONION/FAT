# Frametrap Checker

## How to Use

### Link Mode
Select your first move on the left (this move is assumed BLOCKED by the opponent), and your second move on the right.

FAT will show the first move's "on block" data, the second move's "startup" data, and below that the gap in frames between the two.

### Cancel Mode
A bit more complicated. You must start by selecting your first move. This will then load the second move dropdown with moves that can be cancelled from the first move.

Then select your second move.

FAT will then assume that the move is being cancelled on the first active frame and will display the first move's blockstun, the second move's startup and the gap in frames between the two.

## Changing Character
You can change character using the circular button in the bottom right.

# What is a Frame Trap?
A "Frame Trap" is a 2-move sequence with a gap in the middle that attempts to trick your opponent into pressing a button, thus scoring you a counterhit.
