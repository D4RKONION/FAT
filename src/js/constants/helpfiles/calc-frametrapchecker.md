# Frametrap Checker

## What is a Frame Trap?
A __Frame Trap__ is a 2-move sequence with a gap in the middle that attempts to trick your opponent into pressing a button, thus scoring you a counterhit.

This calculator will let you know what the gap is between two moves. In time, you'll learn to do this maths yourself, but for now FAT's here to help!

## How to Use FTC

### Link Mode
Select your __First Move__ (the move your opponent blocked), and your __Second Move__ (the move you hope to follow up with).

FAT will calculate the gap between the two moves. 

_Second Move Startup -  First Move On Block_.

### Cancel Mode
You must start by selecting your __First move__. This will then load the __Second Move__ dropdown with moves that can be cancelled from the First Move.

FAT will then calculate the gap between the two moves.

_First Move Blockstun - Second Move Startup_.
