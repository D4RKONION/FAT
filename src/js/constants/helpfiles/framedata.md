# Frame Data

## What's Frame Data?!
If you don't fully understand frame data, I highly suggest you check out Gearld from [@CoreAGaming](https://twitter.com/CoreAGaming)'s excellent [explanation video](https://youtu.be/uQnfm911Xoc). I won't be going in depth here, but I'll try to give you the bare minimum you need to understand what's going on.

## Detailed Move Data
You can tap a move row to see more details about that move

## Changing Character
You can switch between two characters quickly using the switcher at the top.

Tapping the character you already have selected will bring up the character select menu.

If you're looking at SFV data, you can use the VTrigger switcher to quickly change between states. Changed moves will be highlighted.

## Character Stats
You can view your characters stats by tapping the "Tap for more !" button at the top of the page


## Portrait View
This is the default view of the frame data page and always displays the following columns:

### Move Name
This is the name of the move. It can be changed between offical, common and inputs in the settings menu.

### S = Startup
How many frames it takes before the move becomes 'active'.

_(the last startup frame and the first active frame are the same frame)_.

### A = Active
How many frames a move remains active (can hurt opponents) for.

### R = Recovery
How many frames it takes for a move to finish after it's been active.

### oB = On Block
How + or - a move is on block. These are shaded based on how safe or unsafe a move is. This can be turned off in the three-dot menu.

### oH = On Hit
How + or - a move is on hit. You can switch the __Counter Hit__ advantage in the three-dot menu.


## Landscape View
Also known as [Nutrient](https://twitter.com/nutrient16) mode, you can have FAT display the columns of your choosing in Landscape Mode. Change them in the three-dot menu.
