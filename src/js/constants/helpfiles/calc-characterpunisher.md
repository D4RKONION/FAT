# Character Punisher

## What is a Punish?
A __Punish__ is a move that you counterattack your opponent with after you block something. Your opponent will still be recovering from their move so there's nothing they can do about it!

This calculator will take one of __your character's__ moves and tell you every single move of your opponent's that it can punish!

## How to Use Character Punisher
The dropdown contains a list of __your character's__ moves (i.e. the move you'd like to _punish_ with). Select one to get started.

FAT will display a list of moves that your selected move can punish, and how easy it is to punish it. You can change the opponent being tested using the circle in the bottom right.
