# Yaksha Search

## Yaksha?!
Yaksha Search is named after and based on the beloved frame data discord bot [Yaksha](https://github.com/ellipses/Yaksha), made by my good and not cringe friend [Tom](https://twitter.com/TheEllipsis_).

## How to Use
Search for a move using the following format.

`characterName moveName`

For Example

`ZekuOld, fireball lvl 1`

This will create a data card of the move you're looking for. You can tap more details to see everything the move does.

The comma is SUPER important. If you don't include it, FAT will use whoever is your current __Player 1__.

## Fuzzy Searching
Yaksha Search uses fuzzy searching so your spelling doesn't have to be perfect. Play around and see what you can find!
