# Frame Trap Lister

## How to Use
Provide Frame Trap Lister with a positive number. This number represents the amount of frames you'd like in your frametrap.

FAT will list all possible move sequences which can be performed to give a frame-gap of this size.

FAT assumes that you inputted these two moves perfectly in game, one after the other, with no gap in between.

## Changing Character
You can change character using the circular button in the bottom right.

# What is a Frame Trap?
A "Frame Trap" is a 2-move sequence with a gap in the middle that attempts to trick your opponent into pressing a button, thus scoring you a counterhit.
