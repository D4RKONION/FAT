# Frame Trap Lister

## What is a Frame Trap?
A __Frame Trap__ is a 2-move sequence with a gap in the middle that attempts to trick your opponent into pressing a button, thus scoring you a counterhit.

This calculator will list all possible move sequences which can be performed to create a frame-gap of a given size.

## How to Use FTL
Provide Frame Trap Lister with a positive number. This number represents the amount of frames you'd like in your frame trap.

You can also toggle whether you want the moves to be normals and/or safe.

FAT assumes that you inputted these two moves perfectly in game, one after the other, with no gap in between.
