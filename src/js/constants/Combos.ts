LP is slow, MP is fast, HP goes up. It's too slow to AA with the up one but it's just swell for combos. EX can still be steered (LP+MP for slow, LP+HP for fast, MP+HP for up) and leaves the opponent standing, which is good for confirming into second mirror. EX is safe but point blank meterless fireballs are punishable. All can be delayed and gain an extra hit+some damage and plusframes when fully charged.

Higher strengths move farther. LK and MK come out fast but don't knock down, HK and EX knock down. They can all be spaced somewhat to be safer but MK is often minus on hit and all are punishable on block by at least lights if they connect point blank. EX comes out really fast, cancels to V-trigger on 1st or 2nd hit, and is neutral on block, so it's pretty great. This move is good for combos because it requires no down charge, moves far, and comes out fast, so you see it a lot in his combos. If you can't get a launcher this is a fine ender.","author":"Bafael","comSour":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbKg7XU2H4"},{"input":"Dangerous Headbutt - Charge down, up+punch","damage":"","stun":"","comments":"Urien's headbutt. Definitely charges faster than his other specials. It doesn't actually hit crouchers so you have to be careful about comboing into it, but it's insanely fast (even the HP version combos from lights!). It's useful in some of his juggles here and there. It's also tall enough that you can hit jumping opponents with the light one, but it doesn't seem to have upper body invincibility on any version. This move still whiffs pretty fast so I guess you could even use it to go over low pokes or just rapidly get in for a throw, it's only -2 if they block it too. EX hits crouchers and has full body invincibility, but it's -17 and is counterhit punishable, so enjoy getting crush countered if they block. If EX headbutt hits, even as a reversal, you can then combo an EX tackle on reaction, which is pretty nice even for the meter cost.","author":"Bafael","comSour":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbKg7XU2H4"},{"input":"Violence Knee Drop - Charge down, up+kick","damage":"","stun":"","comments":"This move is pretty awesome.

If I did a serious video trying to find them all and make sure they were optimal I wouldn't release it for months, so let's just show off some of the important and simple ones. Urien's mirror only adds to damage scaling once (not counting the natural 10% scaling added for all v-trigger combos) even if you hit the opponent back and forth into it, so there's not that much scaling on these combos, and he can often use two mirrors in the same combo, though for now it seems a lot better in footsies than in a two mirror combo. You get more damage out of grounded v-trigger combos, but I think air ones can still be OK to give you guaranteed v-skills or good oki or whatever.","author":"Bafael","comSour":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbKg7XU2H4"},{"input":"st.

You can convert the final hit of the combo to super if you want and it still does nice damage due to minimum scaling, but don't try to fit an EX in here, I think. Using two mirrors will get you down to 10% too fast from what I can find. st. HP was chosen as a starter because it doesn't launch (though you can also use f+MP f+HP or charged HK, f+MP), the third mirror normal can be f+MP instead of cr. MP for a bit of extra damage but that actually doesn't work at absolutely point blank so I chose the more consistent combo at the loss of 5~ damage.\\nIt's important to note the hits between mirrors can potentially be replaced with lows or overheads for cool resets.
